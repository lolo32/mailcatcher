#Comments           Additional information that should be displayed for diagnostic purposes.
#CompanyName        Company that produced the file?for example, "Microsoft Corporation" or

#                       Generated from Cargo.toml
#FileDescription    File description to be presented to users. This string may be displayed in a list box
#                   when the user is choosing files to install?for example, "Keyboard Driver for AT-Style
#                   Keyboards".
#                       Generated from Cargo.toml
#FileVersion        Version number of the file?for example, "3.10" or "5.00.RC2".
#                       Generated from Cargo.toml
#InternalName       Internal name of the file, if one exists?for example, a module name if the file is a
#                   dynamic-link library. If the file has no internal name, this string should be the original
#                   filename, without extension.
#                       Generated from Cargo.toml
#LegalCopyright     Copyright notices that apply to the file. This should include the full text of all notices,

#OriginalFilename   Original name of the file, not including a path. This information enables an application
#                   to determine whether a file has been renamed by a user. The format of the name depends on
#                   the file system for which the file was created.
#                       Generated from Cargo.toml
#PrivateBuild       Information about a private version of the file?for example, "Built by TESTER1 on \TESTBED".
#                   This string should be present only if VS_FF_PRIVATEBUILD is specified in the fileflags
#                   parameter of the root block.

#                       Generated from Cargo.toml
#ProductVersion     Version of the product with which the file is distributed?for example, "3.10" or "5.00.RC2".

#SpecialBuild       Text that indicates how this version of the file differs from the standard version
#                   for example, "Private build for TESTER1 solving mouse problems on M250 and M250E computers".
#                   This string should be present only if VS_FF_SPECIALBUILD is specified in the fileflags
#                   parameter of the root block.
