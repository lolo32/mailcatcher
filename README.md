# MailCatcher

## What can I do, what's that?

This software can be used to have a SMTP mail server on any computer that
accept any mail and display them using any web browser, and does not really
send them to any remote recipient address.

It acts as a SMTP server that can be used on port 1025 (_25 for default 
port_), and a web server that display the deceived mail on port 1080 (_80 
for default port_).
