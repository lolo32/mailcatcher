# MailCatcher

## What can I do, what's that?

This software can be used to have a fake SMTP server on any computer and 
display them using any web browser.

It acts as a SMTP server that can be used on port 1025 (_25 for default 
port_), and a web server that display the deceived mail on port 1080 (_80 
for default port_).
